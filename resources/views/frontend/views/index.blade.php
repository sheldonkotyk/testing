		<h2>Getting Started</h2>
		<p>Here are a number of screen cast videos to get you started with testing this software:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/everbaron/review/77448015/eb4fee5dce">Setting up an account, logging in, creating admin groups and admins</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/everbaron/review/77448014/b0c504706a">Forms</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/everbaron/review/77447099/8dc0de12d3">Settings</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/everbaron/review/77447096/cd75620a1b">Manage Email Templates and Set up a sponsorship program</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/everbaron/review/77447097/4586e8efc8">Adding Children</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/everbaron/review/77447098/82e7d8ee0d">Adding Donors (sponsors)</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Additional Instructions</h3>
		<p>Each of the videos above should be watched in order as they follow the logical progression of setting up a sponsorship program within the software. To understand how the different areas of the software fit together it may help to visualize it as a wheel with several spokes. In the center, the hub is the sponsorship program. Attached to the program are the spokes, which are the various modules within the software. Each module, such as admins and admin groups, email templates, settings, and forms, are set up independently and then linked to the program. Each module can be linked to one program or linked to multiple programs.</p>
